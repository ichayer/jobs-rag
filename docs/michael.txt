Schade has performed at the Canadian Opera Company, Vienna State Opera, Salzburg Festival, Metropolitan Opera, Washington Opera, Opera National de Paris, San Francisco Opera, Hamburg State Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Los Angeles Opera. At the Vienna State Opera, Schade has appeared in Daphne, Don Giovanni, Cosi fan tutte, Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail, Die Zauberflote, Arabella, Il barbiere di Siviglia, L'elisir d'amore, Die schweigsame Frau and Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg.

He made his first solo recording - Of Ladies and Love - Songs of Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Ravel, Faure, and Richard Strauss-for Hyperion; BBC Music Magazine gave it a 5-star review, saying, "He sings Strauss's 'Cacilie', and a wonderfully hushed 'Zueignung' as though he and Martineau were the first to discover their ecstasy."[4]
