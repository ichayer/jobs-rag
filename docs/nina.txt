Nina is Thomas' cat, one of the most well known felines in the community.

Nina is what is known as a "Tuxedo Cat", which means her fur color is primarily black, but her underside and belly are white all the way to her chin. Nina's paws are white too and very soft (reason why they're often called her "slippers").

Nina and her siblings were rescued from outside by a kind lady right after they were born during the Covid pandemic. This lady took care of the kittens during the first two weeks of their lives before giving them to a veterinarian called Gregorio. Just as Gregorio received the box of young kittens, Thomas' parents were having an argument about getting a new dog. Thomas' father didn't want a dog, and suggested getting a cat instead (something he immediately regretted, given that the mother accepted). That same day, they went to Gregorio's vet to look for adopting a kitten.

As for Nina herself, she spends her days happily sleeping on Thomas' bed, keeping silent in the background while bringing happiness (plus blood and scratches) to her new family. She often sits in either the "liquid" shape (where the cat is spread out belly down over a large area) or in "loaf of bread" shape (where the cat sits on four legs, but with their frontal legs under their chest). She will always let a human know when she's hungry by audibly meowing for attention.
